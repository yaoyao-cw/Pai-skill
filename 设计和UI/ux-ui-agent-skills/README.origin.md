## The output, rendered


Not a mockup. These are screenshots of the files in `examples/`, taken by
`node scripts/screenshot_docs.mjs` from the same HTML the 44 gates measure — so
what you see below is what the gate run passed, in both themes.

**Click through them yourself: [plugin87.github.io/ux-ui-agent-skills](https://plugin87.github.io/ux-ui-agent-skills/)**
 — 49 live pages: twenty whole-product screens, every component harness, both
reference screens, with a theme toggle. No install, no clone.

<img src=".github/images/dashboard-light.png" alt="Atlas revenue console in light theme: sidebar navigation, a hero net-recurring-revenue figure at 2.48 million with a weekly bar chart, retention and churn cards, a donut of revenue by plan, an account ranking, regional sparklines, a sortable renewals table and an activity feed" />

<img src=".github/images/dashboard-dark.png" alt="The same Atlas console in dark theme, rendered from the same token theme with no per-page palette" />

<img src=".github/images/terminal-dark.png" alt="Meridian Terminal: a trading desk screen with a market ticker, candlestick chart with volume and moving average, order book with depth bars, cumulative depth curve, time and sales tape, watchlist sparklines, stacked area allocation, waterfall attribution, bubble chart and a correlation matrix" />

**Meridian Terminal** is the density test: **ten chart types on one screen** -
candlestick, volume, moving average, depth, order book, tape, sparklines,
stacked area, waterfall, bubble and a correlation matrix - every one of them
inline SVG drawn from the same tokens, no chart library.
[Open it live.](https://plugin87.github.io/ux-ui-agent-skills/terminal/)
Build one yourself with **`/data-dashboard`**.

**Atlas** is one HTML file in `examples/showcase/`, built only from the kit's
tokens and rules: the hero figure leads at 3x the body size, the three
breakdowns are deliberately three different shapes rather than three identical
cards, the range tabs move the numbers, and the table headers really sort.
[Open it live.](https://plugin87.github.io/ux-ui-agent-skills/showcase/)

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src=".github/images/reference-app-light.png" alt="Reference app in light theme: an Analytics screen led by one hero revenue metric, three smaller stats beneath it, a settings form, and a red Delete account action" /></td>
<td width="50%"><img src=".github/images/reference-app-dark.png" alt="The same Analytics screen in dark theme, rendered from the same token theme with no per-page palette" /></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src=".github/images/button-states-light.png" alt="Button harness in light theme showing primary, disabled, loading, secondary, danger and toggle states side by side" /></td>
<td><img src=".github/images/button-states-dark.png" alt="The same button states in dark theme, with the destructive action still wearing the danger variant" /></td>
</tr>
</table>

One theme, two modes, no per-page palette. The destructive action wears the
danger variant in both. Loading keeps full strength and swaps in a spinner
instead of borrowing the disabled dimming. Every one of those is a rule in
`CLAUDE.md` that a gate or a critic enforces.

---

## What the gates actually catch


Left: the same dashboard written the way a model writes it when nothing stops it -
the indigo-to-purple gradient, four equal cards with no focal point, emoji as
icons, one radius and one shadow everywhere, grey-on-white body text, and a blue
Delete Account. Right: the reference app in this repo.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src=".github/images/before-slop.png" alt="A generated-looking analytics dashboard: purple gradient header with emoji, four identical stat cards, grey low-contrast labels, tiny icon buttons, and a blue Delete Account button" /><br><b>Statistical defaults</b></td>
<td width="50%"><img src=".github/images/reference-app-light.png" alt="The same dashboard built to the kit's rules: one hero revenue metric leading, three smaller stats, a settings panel, and a red Delete account action" /><br><b>Built to the rules</b></td>
</tr>
</table>

The difference is not a matter of opinion, and that is the point. The page on the
left is `tests/fixtures/bad/slop-screen.html`; here is what the gates say about it:

| Gate | Verdict on the left-hand page |
|---|---|
| REAL-render WCAG | `x <h1> "Analytics Dashboard" 1.00:1 (need 3)` - white text on a gradient has no measurable background |
| State-aware WCAG | `x default "Save Changes" 1.00:1 (need 4.5) [rgb(255,255,255) on rgb(255,255,255)]` - 6 states below AA |
| Target size (2.5.8) | `x button.icon-btn is 15.3x16 (min 24x24)` |
| Responsive | `x @280px overflow +820px (widest: div.card)` |
| axe-core | `SERIOUS target-size` |
| Slop tells | HIGH: hardcoded indigo-purple gradient, single radius, one flat shadow, `#000` on `#fff` |
| Taste audit | HIGH: biggest heading 24px vs 14px body = 1.7x, not a display scale |
| Token by intent | `x "Delete Account" is destructive but filled with rgb(99, 102, 241) (hue 239deg, not a danger colour)` |
| No emoji | `x slop-screen.html:55: emoji/pictograph` - a chart glyph in the `<h1>` |
| No hardcoded values | `FAIL: 63 hardcoded value(s)` |

Ten gates reject it, none of them on a matter of taste. The right-hand page
passes all 44.

The last row is there because building this comparison broke a gate open.
`lint_intent` originally read that blue Delete Account as fine: it resolved
"primary" and "danger" from the page's own CSS variables, and a page with no
tokens resolved neither, so it skipped the page and reported zero intent-bearing
controls. An untokenised page is precisely where intent gets picked by
convenience, so the gate no longer looks away - a destructive label filled with a
saturated colour outside the danger hue range is wrong-intent with or without a
theme. Re-checked against every example in both themes afterwards: no false
positives.

`tests/meta/browser-gates.test.mjs` pins every claim in this table, so it cannot
rot.

---

## It was run blind, and it came back as rework

Two subagents were handed a brief and a project scaffolded by `ux-ui-skills new`
— which installs the kit and ships **no example screens** — and nothing else. No
hints, no warning that anything would be scored, no access to the conversation
that built the kit. They met `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/rules/` the way a new
user's agent does.

**Both scored 14/14** on an independent run of `evals/run.mjs`, scored here
rather than self-reported. The rules transfer across a cold start.

**And the two runs cost the kit seven defects that four in-session runs never
hit**, because a familiar run keeps reaching for a finished demo theme instead of
the template a real user gets: a secondary button at **1.13:1** dark-on-dark
because the component tier never followed the dark map; a reduced-motion policy
in an external stylesheet read as "no policy" (Chromium treats a `file://` linked
sheet as cross-origin, so the gate was blind exactly where every real project
lives); a missing scrim token; a theme that emitted colours and no spacing; an
intent gate that did not know "cancel subscription" is destructive.

Then the outputs went to `/critique`, which renders the work and argues for
rejection. Verdict on two pages that pass all fourteen gates: **rework**, eight
findings, five Major, and not one of them measurable — an empty state that reads
as a page that failed to load, a theme toggle that communicates nothing about its
own state, a toast claiming "Draft project created" over a list that never
changed, and a loading state wearing the disabled dimming so it reads as "you
cannot do this".

**The blind outputs were never edited.** They are in `evals/out/` as the record
of what a cold-start agent produced; patching them would be editing the
experiment. The findings were spent on the kit instead — one of them became a
gate, `verify_interactive.mjs`, which fails any control that declares a state
contract and changes nothing when clicked.

The whole log, including what is still unproven, is in
[evals/RESULTS.md](evals/RESULTS.md).

## Quick Start


### Option A — Install as a Claude Code plugin (recommended)

Two lines in Claude Code, and every skill, command, and agent is available in any
project you open — no files copied into your repo:

```
/plugin marketplace add plugin87/ux-ui-agent-skills
/plugin install ux-ui-agent-skills@ux-ui-agent-skills
```

You get 19 skills (`/design-component`, `/data-dashboard`, `/brandkit`, …), 5 commands
(`/gate`, `/critique`, `/grill-me`, `/ship`, `/scaffold-project`), and the
`design-critic` agent. The `design-doctrine` skill carries the house rules that
`CLAUDE.md` carries in the repo, because a plugin root `CLAUDE.md` is not loaded
as project context.

**Then just work.** Ask for the thing you want and the right skill loads itself:

```text
"Design a notification component with all states and accessibility"
"Build the billing settings screen, one shared theme, light and dark"
"/grill-me"      interrogate the brief before anything is built
"/gate"          run all 44 checks and report the real N/N
"/critique"      hand the result to a critic that argues for rejection
```

If the skills do not show up straight away, start a new session. To check what
is loaded, update, or remove it:

```bash
claude plugin details ux-ui-agent-skills    # inventory + token cost per skill
claude plugin update  ux-ui-agent-skills
claude plugin uninstall ux-ui-agent-skills
claude plugin marketplace remove ux-ui-agent-skills
```

### See it first, install nothing

```bash
npx ux-ui-agent-skills demo        # copies the rendered examples and opens them
```

Every page it opens is a page the gates measure. Delete the folder afterwards;
nothing was installed. Or skip the copy entirely and use the
[live demo](https://plugin87.github.io/ux-ui-agent-skills/).

### Option B — Install with `npx`

Drop the kit into any project, no clone needed:

```bash
npx ux-ui-agent-skills init          # full kit into the current folder
npx ux-ui-agent-skills add tokens taste design-systems   # just some areas
npx ux-ui-agent-skills list          # see all areas
```

Flags: `--force` (overwrite existing files) · `--dry` (preview, change nothing).

Working on the kit itself, or want it vendored? [Clone and copy](docs/GUIDE.md#install-from-a-clone) instead.

**Then start using** — open the project in **Claude Code** or any Claude-powered IDE. `CLAUDE.md` loads automatically, activating the agent persona with full access to every tokens / components / taste / design-system file and the runnable `/skills`.

<details>
<summary><b>Example prompts</b></summary>

<br>

```text
"Design a notification component with all states and accessibility"
"Review this login page against WCAG 2.2 and Nielsen's heuristics"
"Generate React + Tailwind code for a data table with sorting and pagination"
"Create a color token palette for a fintech brand using blue as the primary"
"Audit this form for accessibility issues — give me a prioritized findings table"
"Write the empty state and error copy for the onboarding flow"
"Spec the motion for the modal open/close with reduced-motion fallback"
```

</details>

## Proving It, and Admitting What Cannot Be Proven


The kit ships **44 objective gates** behind one command:

```bash
node scripts/accuracy_report.mjs     # 44/44 or it fails — no partial credit
```

**31 of them open a real browser, so they need one installed.** Playwright is not
pulled in by `/plugin install` or `npx ux-ui-agent-skills init`, so run this once
in the kit directory before expecting a full score:

```bash
npm install                          # playwright
npx playwright install chrome        # real Chrome: six gates require the channel
```

Without it those 31 report `REQUIRED, FAILING` under `accuracy_report.mjs`, which
is the honest answer. Run individually they print `SKIPPED` and **exit 0** — so
prefix any single render gate with `DS_REQUIRE_BROWSER=1` if you are reading its
exit code, rather than reading silence as green.

Token validity, WCAG contrast on a real headless render in light *and* dark, every
element in default/hover/focus, axe roles and names, focus traps, RTL, responsive
at 280/320/414, target size, keyboard operability, reduced motion (including
content that only an animation reveals), silent text clipping, token-by-intent,
and zero emoji anywhere in the output or the instruction surface.

**What that number covers, stated exactly.** 31 of the 44 checks open a real
browser, so what they measure is **rendered HTML**: the 23 component harnesses,
the twenty industry screens, the reference app, the live demo, the starter
template. The other 13 read files — token JSON and alias resolution, contrast
math on the token source, component specs, hardcoded values, theme references,
emoji, the instruction surface, and destructive-intent declarations in framework
source.

Framework source (`.tsx`, `.vue`, `.swift`) is therefore reached by the
file-reading checks only: no emoji, no hardcoded values, every `var(--…)`
resolving to the theme, and — since a blue Delete shipped in this repo's own
`Settings.tsx` while the HTML twin of that screen was correct — every
destructive control declaring its intent (`lint_intent_source.mjs`). That last
one proves a **declaration**, never a colour: `variant="destructive"` wired to a
blue token passes it, and only a render catches that. A React component this kit
generates is written to the token and accessibility rules in `.claude/rules/`,
but it is **not** proven by this number until it is rendered and measured.
Rendering framework components through the same gates is still open work, named
here rather than implied away.

That is correctness. It is not quality, and the kit says so out loud:

| Question | Answer | How |
|---|---|---|
| Is it correct? | Measured, all or nothing | `node scripts/accuracy_report.mjs` -> a real `N/N` |
| Is it any good? | Judged, never scored | `/critique` — an adversarial `design-critic` that renders the work, argues for rejection, and cites evidence per finding |
| Does the kit transfer to a cold start? | Measured, one brief at a time | `evals/` — cold-start briefs, then `node evals/run.mjs <brief-id>` points 14 objective gates at what the agent produced |

`/critique` exists because a passing gate is never evidence of taste. It refuses to
review from source alone, screenshots at 1280 and 390 in both themes, clicks every
control, and returns a verdict with the three reasons a senior designer would send
the work back.

Runs are recorded in `evals/RESULTS.md` with their provenance attached — who built the output and whether they could see the kit while doing it — because a run without that context is not evidence of anything.

The eval suite exists because "the kit's own examples pass" is a weaker claim than
"an agent given only this kit and a brief produces work that passes". Building it
caught two real defects the 34-check gate had missed. See `evals/README.md`.

## Contributing


Two commands are the whole bar: `node scripts/accuracy_report.mjs` (44/44, no
partial credit) and `npm run test:gates` (every gate must still reject its
broken fixture). Paste the real output in the pull request rather than
describing it.

The most valuable issue this repo can receive is a **gate gap** - a case where a
gate said yes to work it should have caught. There is a template for exactly
that, because a gate that passes broken work is worse than a missing one: it
turns a real defect into a green tick.

[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) covers setup, the non-negotiable rules, how to
add a gate that can still say no, and the SemVer table.
[CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) applies to every space in the project.
